        Diamondkitty is well known to be one of Teddah's best friends, but lets not acknowledge her for that reason. Diamondkitty wasn't known by the whole community in the early stages of this guild, but once she got comfortable here, she started to open up and started bringing her joyfulness and playfulness to this server. She tends to be teased alot, but doesn't take it seriously as she knows its a joke, which is one of her greatest aspects. She can be really nice if you do something good for her, and can be wholesome at times. Her favourite words are "WTF" or "DUDE", her excitement brings something new to the guild which everyone is grateful for
