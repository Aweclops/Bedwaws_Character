        Teddah is a outlier, someone who likes to fit in, yet someone who isolates himself from others. His favourite words are "dude want sex?" or "diamond!". He is someone who is a mysterious person, even though he is mysterious, he brings a fun character/personality to the group. He likes to spam alot yet without him, this discord wouldn't be alive as it is now. His bestfriends are Diamondkitty865 and RainbowColors, he tends to talk to them alot, which results in him being a high mee6 level. He is overall a funny guy and someone who is a major contribution to the guild.
