        Eightypixels isn't known aswell by the whole community, but is a individual who is known by a collective of known guild members. He is generally on discord most of the time, but becomes afk at times, but will accept your request to play some bedwar games with him if you would like. He's a really nice person, and doesn't get mad at you if you mess up at times. He grinds consistently for the day where he becomes famous, he does all his video clipping and editing by himself and personally myself, I respect the grind and hustle for this individual. He's a good friend of mine, and if you get to know this asian king, you will be greeted with kindness and gratitude. He's someone Offer likes to mention alot, one of Offer's very close friends and one my very close friends aswell.
