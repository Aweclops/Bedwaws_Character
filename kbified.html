        Kbified isn't that active on the guild on hypixel anymore, yet he still appears sometimes. He is mostly active on the SMP, which is a private survival server where known guild members play survival, as much as we hope for Kbified to come back, we have to respect his choices, and will proceed to support him in the long run. Kbified is a very kind person, he hardly gets mad at you, and if he does, it will probably cool down in a short span of time, he can be someone who will help you in things, and once you get to know him, he becomes a very kind and honest person, and someone you can rely and put your trust on.
