        An interesting muted individual you see, Offer is quite the puzzle, she likes to harass or tease/bully other guild members online, and tends to be competitive and controlling. People's opinions on her aren't the greatest to say the least but they aren't the worse either. You see, if you get on her bad side, that is trouble for you, countless spams, countless mean words and most importantly, being ignored. Offer creates a somewhat interesting atmosphere to say the least, she can be extremely toxic at times, sometimes extremely horny (kinda weird amirite) and extremely, how do I put this, controlling at times. Offer is someone who probably hates me at this point, and can get extremely annoyed or frustrated. But, I have to admit, she is quite a good bedwars player, but it doesnt dismiss the toxicity she holds within her. Offer can be somewhat nice at times but it doesn't last for long but all this doesn't mean we don't want her here. Offer has a gigantic part in the upbringing of WAWS, and to be honest, wouldn't be here without here, so thanks Offer!
