        Well you see, DuckIQ is a very interesting human being, he/she is a unknown specimen of some sort that no one has any info on. DuckIQ seems to act like a higher minority of some sort, someone who likes to be proud and supposedly 'righteous', we all believe that DuckIQ is a toddler (which is around 12 or 11). DuckIQ tends to be quite annoying at some times, he quotes "[c]aptain [a]weclops is using reach and bhop", he tends to act like he's a higher upper being or someone who is older than us, even though he is someone who we treat as someone who is still learning as he is still in his toddler years
