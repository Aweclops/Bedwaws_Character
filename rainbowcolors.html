        RainbowColors is someone you don't see on this server often, but is a well known member in this guild community. She is someone who doesn't open up to people, but once you get to know her, she becomes a really nice and funny individual. She is one of Teddah's best friends, but if you get to know her, she can possibly become your new best friend too. Overall, shes a very wholesome player, and someone you can be honest and trust.
